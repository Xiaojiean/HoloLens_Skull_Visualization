# HoloLensSkullVisualization

This project provides a better visualization of preoperative Computed Tomography (CT) scan of a patientâ€™s skull using Augmented Reality. 
It uses a custom shader to dynamically adjust the clipping plane of any object in the Unity scene, so that surgeon can adjust the clipping plane of a skull mesh model to look inside the patient's skull.

## Features
* Two hand manipulation of the skull.
* Adjustable clipping plane to scroll through the skull in any angle or direction.
